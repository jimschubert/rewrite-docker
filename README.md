# rewrite-docker

This is a pet project to support dockerfiles in OpenRewrite.

It does _not_ work well enough for you to use it. It's a work in progress. I can't promise that it will ever be finished.

TODOs:

* Update all types with Right-padded literals to have simplified with* methods
* Throw parser errors for invalid syntaxes or usages
* Support dockerfile syntaxes
